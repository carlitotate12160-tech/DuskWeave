# DuskWeave Build Order

## Purpose

This file is the canonical navigation index for DuskWeave build sequencing.

Detailed stage definitions live under `docs/build-order/` so agents do not need to load the entire lifecycle for every task.

Principle:

> Campaign semantics first. Reality/evidence second. Execution third. Tools last.

## Authority hierarchy

1. Product Thesis / accepted PRD
2. Accepted ADR
3. Domain Contract
4. QUALITY_BAR.md
5. AGENTS.md
6. Relevant DuskWeave skill under .agents/skills/
7. Implementation

PRDs define WHAT/WHY. ADRs define architectural HOW. Code may not invent architecture that has no accepted authority.

## Canonical build-order packets

| Packet | Scope | Stages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [00](build-order/00-authority-and-invariants.md) | Authority hierarchy and hard invariants | Global |
| [01](build-order/01-foundation-design.md) | Repository bootstrap, product thesis, campaign semantics, foundation ADRs | 0–3 |
| [02](build-order/02-reality-and-domain.md) | Observation/evidence, domain contracts, campaign state, terrain, footholds, paths, objectives | 4–10 |
| [03](build-order/03-capability-and-execution.md) | Capability model, execution architecture, first adapters | 11–13 |
| [04](build-order/04-campaign-intelligence.md) | Expansion, chain composition, adaptation | 14–16 |
| [05](build-order/05-stealth-proof-and-observer.md) | Stealth/control-gap, client proof, telemetry, grader | 17–20 |
| [06](build-order/06-memory-and-scenarios.md) | Campaign memory and threat-derived scenarios | 21–22 |
| [07](build-order/07-delivery-and-seals.md) | Slice rules, file rules, STOP conditions, delivery loop, current action, seals | Delivery |

Only read the packet required by the active engineering state, plus packet 00 and packet 07 when needed for invariants or delivery rules.

## Current permitted work

[ENGINEERING_STATE section 6](ENGINEERING_STATE.md#6-current-slices-and-next-action)
owns active work, next action and milestone evidence. Read PR/candidate/CI state
from GitHub; this index does not repeat mutable delivery status or merge history.

The selected M1 lane is governed by the accepted
[external-orientation contract](contracts/M1-external-orientation-decision-loop.md)
and [enabling architecture](contracts/M1-enabling-architecture.md), including its
bounded sequencing substitutions. [ADR-016](adr/ADR-016-execution-broker.md)
owns execution/lifecycle admission and [ADR-015](adr/ADR-015-execution-boundary.md)
owns deployment boundaries. Selected-lane acceptance does not accept missing
full-stage dependencies or qualify a deployment, provider, target action or seal.

The [roadmap](MVP_AND_DEFERRED_SCOPE.md#12-autonomous-campaign-delivery-order-owner-direction-2026-10-19)
owns product priorities and deferred breadth. Execute only the current assigned
outcome after verifying its dependencies; completed DW-* assignments are historical.

## Mandatory invariants

The detailed definitions are canonical in [00-authority-and-invariants.md](build-order/00-authority-and-invariants.md).

Summary:

- INV-001: No God Object.
- INV-002: Keep CyberTerrain, FootholdGraph, AttackPathView, ObjectiveState, and CampaignTrajectory separate.
- INV-003: Reasoning is not execution.
- INV-004: Observation is not fact.
- INV-005: Raw client content and operational secrets stay outside ordinary/core surfaces; only separately authorized campaign-scoped secret custody may retain an operational value for bounded reuse, with opaque core references and accountable disposal.
- INV-006: Campaign capabilities cannot alter authoritative audit evidence.
- INV-007: Blind campaigns exclude privileged defender-oracle feeds; authorized campaign-visible effects and legitimately acquired telemetry may inform bounded adaptation, while separately authorized defender-informed exercises are labeled and evaluated independently. See PRD-000 §6.

## Navigation rule for agents

Before substantial work:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/ENGINEERING_STATE.md`.
3. Read this index.
4. Read `docs/build-order/00-authority-and-invariants.md`.
5. Read only the build-order packet containing the active stage.
6. Read the relevant PRD and accepted ADRs.
7. Read `QUALITY_BAR.md`.
8. Read `.agents/skills/build-duskweave/SKILL.md`.

If the requested work belongs to a later stage than `docs/ENGINEERING_STATE.md` permits, stop with `SPLIT_REQUIRED` or an authority/dependency finding.

## Anti-monolith rule

This index must remain a navigation document, not grow back into a full lifecycle specification.

Target size:

- preferred: under 200 lines
- hard review threshold: 250 lines

Detailed stage semantics belong in `docs/build-order/*.md`.

Do not duplicate a stage definition in both this index and a packet.

## Seal ownership

Current and historical seal status belongs in `docs/ENGINEERING_STATE.md`.

This index describes sequencing; it does not independently declare implementation completion.
